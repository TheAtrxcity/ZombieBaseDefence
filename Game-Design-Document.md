## Core Loop
**Day Phase**
Player sends out units to gather resources.
With the resources the player can build the base or level up the unit. 
**Night Phase**
Player protects base against zombie horde that grows every day.

## Gameplay
The player manages a colony that he/she has the grow.
The player will start of as a lone survivor and only has a tent.
He will then have to gather resources to build up the colony.

The first day the player would have a little bit of resources, say enough to build a couple walls. The player has a full stomach and is quenched. The game should guide the player into the mechanics by letting the player experience the loop for the first time.

The first day should be something along the lines of:
Exploring to gather resources the player would need enough resources to build a watch tower, a field and a water catcher. 

The player will have action points (energy?) to spend on exploration. The player then has to select a location the player wants to travel to.

On the first exploration the player should be able to get all the resources necessary. They will also encounter another person they can invite to join the colony. And they will find a piece of equipment.

After the exploration the player will have resources to build all the necessary items to survive by himself.

The player should then have to build all the items in the players colony. Then should be prompted about the piece of equipment the player found.

The player has to click on the players starting unit or the colonist to open up a window that shows the players stats and the equipment it's carrying. Then when the unit has a piece of equipment that's better then what the unit is carrying it should show up a +, ^ or a dot to indicate that. When the player clicks on that they then open up an inventory of items that the player can equip. 

After the player is done exploring all the options the player can click on prepare for the night and will start a base/tower defence sequence. 

The player can only watch what happens and see how well the player has prepared defences. If the player is overrun the player loses the game. 

The fun of the game should be balancing risk with for example carrying out higher level explorations to get better and more resources. And managing the colony well enough so noone dies of thirst, hunger or illness. The player should be able to try different strategies for example focusing on equipment for units or resources to build stronger defences. 

### Exploration Addon:

## Concept Art
Top left shows costs for having certain building and the resources it would take to make them. It shows shelters giving you population spots.
It shows a farm, a water gatherer, shelter in the form of tents and watch towers.

Top Right shows the exploration system. It shows a sideview of when the exploration happens. This is subject to change with the new exploration addon.
